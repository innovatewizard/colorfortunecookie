# Flutter Dummy App #1: Color Fortune Cookie

This repo contains the Flutter project that builds a cross-platform mobile app that simple generates a random color and prompts a GPT-3 model to give a fortune cookie style "fortune" inspired by that color.

In *lib/main.dart* simply assign a valid OpenAI API Key to the `String apiKey` variable.
